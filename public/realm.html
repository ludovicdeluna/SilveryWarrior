  </li>
  <li><strong>Premeditation</strong> Have at least 850 Dark Temples before affiliating with the Drow. <ul>
  <li>Affiliation happens when you buy the Drow Trade Treaty, and this trophy only cares about the current run. It’s alright if you’ve affiliated with them in the past, and there’s no problem with you buying Underworld Diplomacy and collecting Drow Faction Coins, you just have to have 850 Dark Temples in a run where you don’t yet have Drow Trade Treaty.

  <li>“anything” means clicking the treasure (Gift of the Kings won’t break it though), casting spells, and buying any buildings or upgrades.</li>
  <li>This is currently quite buggy, if it’s not unlocking for you, you might try: <ul>
  <li>Restarting again.</li>
  <li>Closing and relaunching your browser.</li>
  <li>Getting it on the first play of a reincarnation.</li>
  </ul>
